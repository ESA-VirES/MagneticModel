Welcome to eoxmagmod documentation!
===================================

The ``eoxmagmod``_ library collects low-level subroutines employed
by the `VirES for Swarm`_ service to calculate:

- geomagnetic models (Spherical Harmonic expansion)
- magnetic coordinates (quasi-dipole and dipole latitude and longitude, magnetic local time)
- coordinate system conversions (geodetic, geocentric spherical, geocentric Cartesian coordinates)
- time conversions (modified Julian date 2000, decimal year)
- and perform other auxiliary calculations.

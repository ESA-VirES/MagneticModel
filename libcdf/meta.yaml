# CDF library conda build metadata
#

# NOTE: scipy is installed during the build to assure a compatible version
#       of the Fortran compiler and its run-time libraries.
#       conda is not able to resolve version conflicts if the scipy and libcdf
#       are compiled with different versions of the GFortran compiler.
